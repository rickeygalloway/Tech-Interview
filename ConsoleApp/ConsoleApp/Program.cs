	//There's a wide variety of expectations when doing code for a potential interview. We do this often at work and are typically 
	//looking for basic functionality. Not production level code.

	//I basically took the approach of keeping it pretty simple.

	//I also wanted to use Entity Framework, which I think greatly simplifies the code.I started off by choosing to model everything 
	//off of the tables in the database. But since there are no relationships among the tables (at least not by any table constraints), 
	//and I did not want to manually add associations to the edmx file, I based the entire model on a view.I could have easily just 
	//used my same SQL statement with a where clause for member id, but that doesn't really show much.


	//Notes:
	//1.	Use EntityFramework for retrieving data.
	//2.	Ensure that view is created.
	//3.	Encapsulate a few helper classes to clean up the code
	//4.	I purposely did not use any error handling anywhere except when looking for a connectionstring value. This is what is most likely 
	//		error to occur if another dev runs the app.
	//5.	I used inline SQL statements.I almost never do this in a production application no matter how simple the task.
	//6.	Very few comments.I try to name variables and methods that explain what is happening.I did comment the Setup class and explained 
	//		its purpose.
	//7.	Admittedly, I read glassdoor reviews on interviews - and response.Seems I have the same assignment as others.And I did create a 
	//		video of my working application. https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cFhO2xbJdM
